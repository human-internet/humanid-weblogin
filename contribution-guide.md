## What to know when contributing:
* Intro to humanID
  * Why has democracy worked so well in the real world but less so online?
  * The humanID answer comes from the fundamental rule of democracies: one human, one voice. humanID’s mission is to bring this principle to the online world. Democracy works in a way authoritarian alternatives never could. The solution to the 21st century internet’s problems is a centuries old theory of social organization.
